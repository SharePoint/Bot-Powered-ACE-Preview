Welcome to the preview program!

Follow the instruction of the labs available here to get started: https://github.com/SharePoint/BotPoweredACEPreview/wiki. We will use also this wiki for sharing any updates which will be shared with your also in direct messags to reduce the impact of potential breaking changes for your testing.

When (not if) you find something which looks like a bug or you'd like to provide feedback for the engineering - please use the https://github.com/SharePoint/BotPoweredACEPreview/issues list for getting your input written and then let Vesa Juvonen to know in Teams that you have provided input, so that we can jump into your feedback. You can find Vesa from Microsoft Teams directly using vesaj@microsoft.com.

Due to the time zone differences, there might be a small delays on getting you a response, but we will do the best on our side.

This private Bot Powered ACE preview program is quite small with limited set of attendees which means that you will not see tens and tens of people engaging - **your input however is invaluable for Microsoft** around these features.

Thank you 👏🚀

Sharing is caring 🧡
