Due to the time zone differences, there might be a small delays on getting you a response, but we will do the best on our side.

This private Bot Powered ACE preview program is quite small with limited set of attendees which means that you will not see tens and tens of people engaging - **your input however is invaluable for Microsoft** around these features.
