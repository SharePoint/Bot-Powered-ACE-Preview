# SPFx Bot Powered Adaptive Card Extensions for Viva Connections (Preview)

Welcome to the Bot-Driven Adaptive Card Extension preview program!

<h2>Before Getting Started</h2>
To get a better understanding of the use cases of Bot-Driven ACEs and the motivation behind developing this feature, please refer to this document. <br><br>

For more information on the bot builder framework, see the [bot builder framework repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-sdk).

Furthermore, to get started, ensure the account you use to configure the bot is in the same Azure subscription as your tenant.<br>

Note: we're using a fork of the BotBuilder framework due to anticipating changes in the Bot-Driven ACE schema based on feedback during the preview period. Before this feature hits GA, we'll finalize the schema and work with the BotBuilder framework team to merge our changes.
